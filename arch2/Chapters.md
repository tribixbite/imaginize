### Repair

**Source Text:**
> She put on the coat, handed Gelifen to Christopher, and clambered up onto the prow of the boat, standing atop the carved figurehead, which was shaped like an apple. The wind whipped her fringe across her face. She gripped the edges of the coat, spread her arms—and leaped into the sky. Christopher gave a yell, which made Nighthand turn to stare as Mal, arms outstretched, soared suddenly as high as the mast, her coat’s woolen cloth flapping in the wind.

**Source Text:**
> They were passing through a particularly fine square, with a fountain in the form of a mermaid in the center, when there was a noise overhead, of beating wings, and the sky called Nighthand’s name. “Nighthand! Fidens Nighthand, how dare you come to my city without informing me! I would have laid on a feast!” Over the rooftops flew a now familiar horselike creature, its wings beating in the air. Its body was covered in gray-green iridescent scales, and it shone. Its wings too were scaled; scales so fine that delicate pink membranes shone through on the underside.
